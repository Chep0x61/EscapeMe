# EscapeMe

I reworked on one of my project I have made during my first year at Epitech Paris for a JAM weekend.

The JAM's theme was escape ! 

## Description

Completly new website, i just kept the general idea and improved it.
I used basic web skills devlopment with : HTML, CSS & Javascript.

I tried to use the package Three.js on the main page and to do a fully responsive website.
